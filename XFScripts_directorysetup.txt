~~ Instructions for setting up directories for XF scripts ~~


1. You should initially have four files:
    controller.sh
    Evolved_Dipole_CMD.cpp
    dipole_PEC.xmacro
    output.xmacro

2. Place all four files into a directory (I called mine XFScripts)
    mkdir XFScripts
    mv controller.sh XFScripts/
    ...

3. Inside XFScripts, create a directory called Evolved_Dipole:
    cd XFScripts
    mkdir Evolved_Dipole

4. Move Evolved_Dipole_CMD.cpp into Evolved_Dipole and compile the .cpp file:
    mv Evolved_Dipole_CMD.cpp Evolved_Dipole/
    cd Evolved_Dipole
    g++ Evolved_Dipole_CMD.cpp -o Evolved_Dipole

5. Run the Evolved_Dipole executable :
    ./Evolved_Dipole --start
   This should output a file called "handshake.csv"

6. Create directories called "data" and "watches"
    mkdir data
    mkdir watches

7. In watches, create a file called "watch.txt" that contains 0
